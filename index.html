    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This teaching sequence consists of five lessons which are 60-90 minutes each. The learning activities, explanations, definitions, teacher knowledge and resources required to effectively implement this lesson sequence, are included. Throughout this sequence, an abundance of examples of adaptations are depicted and utilised. Students will benefit from exploring the examples to demonstrate deep understanding in their assessments and exams.</p>
    <p>In this sequence, students will develop and enhance some of the Key Science Skills outlined by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) in the VCE Biology Study Design. Students will ‘communicate and explain scientific ideas,’ (VCAA 2017, p.9) to their peers in a species investigation activity, and they will ‘analyse and evaluate data, methods and scientific models’ (VCAA 2017, p.10) in a secondary data investigation, using the raw data from a scientist’s investigation. Students will also explore how biomimicry has been used to solve human challenges. This learning sequence facilitates learning through student centred activities, the creation of resources (by students), communicating scientific ideas to an audience, and collaborative activities. The relationship between adaptations and the real world is highlighted throughout the sequence.</p>

    <h4>Key Knowledge</h4>
    <p>Survival through adaptations and regulation</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The structural, physiological and behavioural adaptations that enhance an organism’s survival and enable life to exist in a wide range of environments</li>
        <li>Successful adaptations as models for biomimicry to solve human challenges</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Key science skills</h4>
    <p>Analyse and evaluate data, methods and scientific models</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Process quantitative data using appropriate mathematical relationships and units</li>
        <li>Organise, present and interpret data using line graphs and calculations of mean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Communicate and explain scientific ideas</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use appropriate biological terminology and representations</li>
        <li>Discuss relevant biological information, ideas, concepts, theories and models and the connections between them</li>
        <li>Use clear, coherent and concise expression</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>By the end of the lesson sequence students should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe what an adaptation is and provide examples in both flora and fauna species</li>
        <li>Compare different species living in a range of habitats and explain why they possess particular adaptations that are suited to their specific environment</li>
        <li>Understand that adaptations enhance an organism’s survival</li>
        <li>Use secondary data to describe how temperature and climatic conditions can influence an animal’s behaviour</li>
        <li>Investigate and research into a species of their own choosing and clearly communicate this information to an audience</li>
        <li>Identify some adaptations in species that have been used by humans to solve problems and challenges</li>
        <li>Understand the interconnectedness of adaptations and how they link to other areas of biology and the real world</li>
    </ul>
