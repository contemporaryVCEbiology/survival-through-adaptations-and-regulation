    <h1>How Do Birds Regulate Temperature?</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">In this lesson, students will be organising, presenting, analysing and interpreting data from a scatterplot they create. Students will be required to hypothesise the relationship between ‘backrest’ behaviour and temperature. Students will be using the information to make conclusions about the ‘back rest’ behaviour in the Sharp-Tailed Sandpiper species and will answer questions that relate to their analysis.</p>

    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <p>Throughout this lesson, students will be analysing data from a scientific investigation. Students will use the data to answer a series of questions. The questions are scaffolded throughout this activity, which provides teachers with the opportunity to differentiate for their students. The secondary data is presented below. You can devise a way for your students to conduct an investigation using this data, or it can be used as a basis for a more open-ended analysis. If a guided inquiry is more desirable, the worksheet and analysis questions for this activity will provide a directed inquiry of data analysis for students. This data analysis is modelled around exam questions for students to practice data interpretation for their assessments, exams and unit 3 &amp; 4 exams.</p>
    <p>Thermoregulation through bird beaks and bills is an adaptation birds have evolved to deal with the challenge of temperature change, to maintain a constant temperature of their internal environment. Species of birds have also developed a behavioural adaptation to deal with colder temperatures. When temperatures are cold, birds tuck their bill/beak into their plumage, this motion is known as ‘back rest’, and it is a way of conserving heat. Interestingly, in very hot temperatures, birds also exhibit the back rest behaviour, so they aren’t taking in extra heat from their external environment through their beak. Over the last 100-150 years, there has been an increase in beak sizes in some species, which is due to climate change. This information can be used to explore other climate issues, and how other organisms have adapted to climate change. The students will be completing this task individually, whilst the teacher moves around the classroom to assist the students. Students should attempt to practice questions individually before consulting their teacher or their peers. At the end of the task, the students will be concluding why the backrest behaviour is a behavioural adaptation. Students will be considering the change in morphology of developing larger beak and bill sizes over the last 100-150 years, and how this is attributed to climate change.</p>

    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 4.1 - <strong>Investigation Using Data to Observe Thermoregulatory Behaviour in Bird Species</strong> (60 minutes)</p>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>It is a common thought for individuals to have the conception that bird beaks are used for foraging, eating, enticing a mate, or perhaps even just a feature similar to hair, fingernails or toenails. The bird beak is non-insulated and is highly vascularised, making it efficient for heat transfer (Ryeland et al. 2017, p. 887). Interestingly, it has been discovered that birds use their bills or beaks to thermoregulate. In the warmer climates, such as environments closer to the equator, the bird beak sizes have adapted to be larger, this is because appendages lose heat. Having a larger beak in a warmer climate is an advantageous adaptation for birds to lose heat, as their bills/beak is highly vascularised and can lose heat easily. This means birds will not have an increase in internal body temperature, when the temperature in the environment around them increases. For example, in the toucan, 60% of heat loss is from its large bill size when it is resting (Ryeland et al. 2017, p. 885). Contrastingly, in cooler climates, bird beaks are smaller, so the species can conserve heat. This has also been observed and recorded in altitude changes. Bird beak thermoregulation and adapting to the climate by having larger or smaller beaks, has been observed in many species such as penguins, grouse, terns, gulls, barbets and parrots. This is known as Allen’s Rule.</p>
        <p>Teacher to show students video on Allen’s rule which relates to species of birds, who thermoregulate through their beak https://video.deakin.edu.au/media/t/0_mvi3uqs4 (Lim, Deakin University 2015)</p>
        <p>Thermoregulation through bird beaks and bills is an adaptation birds have evolved to deal with the challenge of temperature change, to maintain the temperature of their internal environment. Species of birds have also developed a behaviour where they tuck their bill/beak into their plumage, this motion is known as ‘back rest’. The ‘back rest’ motion is what will be investigated throughout this activity.</p>
        <h5>Background Information</h5>
        INSERT IMAGE
        
        <p>Sharp-tailed Sandpipers are migratory birds which live on shores. They breed in Siberia and migrate a long way south, to Australia for their non-breeding season, from September to February (Adams, Museum Victoria 2016). The Sharp-tailed Sandpipers are found all throughout Australia during their migratory season. Sharp-tailed Sandpipers live in <q>“shallow inland freshwater wetlands, mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, rocky shores and beach”</q> (Adams, Museum Victoria 2016). This species exhibits the back rest motion, by tucking their thin beaks behind their plumage. Data on the frequency of the Sharp-tailed Sandpiper exhibiting this behaviour, and the temperature when this behaviour occurs is shown in the table below. Data are sourced from a published paper by Ryeland, Weston &amp; Symonds (2017) Functional Ecology 31: 885-893</p>
        <h5>Purpose</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>To observe the frequency of the back rest behaviour in the Sharp Tailed Sandpiper species (Calidris acuminata)</li>
            <li>To consider why this behaviour is exhibited</li>
        </ul>
