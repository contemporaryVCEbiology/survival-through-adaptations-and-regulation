    <h1>What Adaptations Do Particular Species Exhibit?</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">In this lesson students will investigate the adaptations of a particular species. Students will consider the country/region the species is found in and the environment. Students will investigate thoroughly into the environment where species are found, taking into consideration low/high temperature, low/high altitude, rainfall, salt content, desert, arid, nutrient rich/poor, freezing temperatures and moisture content. Students will also consider the metabolic rate of the species.</p>

            <h4>Student learning outcomes</h4>
            <p>At the completion of this lesson, students should be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate and research into a species of their own choosing and communicate this information to an audience</li>
                <li>Compare different species living in a range of habitats and explain why they possess adaptations that are suited to their specific environment</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <p>This lesson is focused on role play and excitement in the classroom. The momentum of this lesson will depend on the teacher enthusiasm and the ability to utilise some students who enjoy performing arts and public speaking. This lesson should be fun and exciting for the students. Students in this lesson will have the opportunity to create ‘Species Profile Cards’. Students will present this as a word document or a single slide in a PowerPoint through a projector and will be required to present to the class in the next lesson. This is an informal task and is not designed to be assessed, however, the students will be required to answer questions from their peers and teacher in the next lesson. The purpose is to get students communicating scientific phenomena in an informal environment to an audience. The activity does not have to be presented as a role play, however, the role play will encourage student enthusiasm for the task. The ‘Species Profile Cards’ activity can be extended over two lessons if required, or the task can be condensed to include less elements if there are time constraints.</p>
    <p><strong>Prior to lesson:</strong> Get a few students who are enthusiastic and perhaps enjoy performing arts to act as the air hostesses on the plane ride, you can also advise them of the role play scenario and ask them to help build the momentum and enthusiasm for this lesson.</p>
    <h3>Teaching sequence</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p><strong>Activity 2.1 - Role Play:</strong> Students will be ‘location scouts’ for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), and will be journeying to different locations around the world.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity 2.2 - Species Profile Cards:</strong> Students create their own ‘Species Profile Cards’ that will need to convince the BBC of where they film their next documentary on adaptations. Profile cards will contain information such as environment, behavioural, structural and physiological adaptations, prey and predators. This will be done in groups of 2-3. (Depending on time allocated to this activity each member of the group could create their own species card for the same selected environment)</p>
    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 2.1 - <strong>Role Play</strong> (50 minutes)</p>
        <p>This activity will introduce students to some features of organisms and the advantages of possessing such features or behaviours. This activity will engage students in the topic, by showing unique adaptations of species, in addition to utilising species which students may not have known or learnt about before.</p>
