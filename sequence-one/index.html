    <h1>Introduction to Survival Through Adaptations</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">Students are introduced to adaptations. They will observe features and adaptations in two species. Students will distinguish between behavioural, structural and physiological adaptations and explore examples. Using the species cards, students will learn about the environments in which species survive and their adaptations that enhance their survival for their specific environment.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Describe what an adaptation is and provide examples in both flora and fauna species</li>
                <li>Understand that adaptations enhance an organism’s survival</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <p>Students are introduced to adaptations through two videos, one on Venus Fly Traps and the other on the Blood Squirting Horned Lizard. The students will be familiar with some of the features described and explored throughout these videos. Throughout the lesson students will focus on <em><strong>how</strong></em> these features enhance an organisms’ survival, something the students may not have considered before. The teacher will be required to print out the species cards, so each group has a set. Students will observe and describe some features of organisms shown on the species cards, and the students are to hypothesise what they think these features are used for. Students will have the opportunity in their groups to match up species and their adaptations and discuss with each other how and why they enhance the survival of the particular organism.</p>
    <p>There aren’t a large amount of terms or definitions associated with the adaptations topic in this lesson sequence, although, students will benefit greatly from having diverse examples of adaptations and species they understand. They will utilise their knowledge of examples to demonstrate their understanding of an adaptation and being able to describe how it enhances the survival of a species.</p>
    <h4>Teacher Understanding</h4>
    <p>“An adaptation is a genetically controlled structural, behavioural or physiological feature that enhances the survival of an organism in particular environmental conditions” (Kinnear & Martin 2015, p.194). These adaptations have different purposes in different organisms including defending itself, camouflage from predators, avoiding predator detection, acquiring prey, avoiding poisonous food/prey, minimising water loss, diving into deep water, reducing heat loss, surviving in harsh environments such as desserts or at the freezing poles of the earth.</p>
    <p>A commonly observed misconception, is that some students think an individual organism will develop an adaptation in response to an environmental stimulus, and not through a mutation that has occurred or been inherited. The teacher should explain the following information to the students, so students avoid such misconceptions. As some mutations are passed from generation to generation, this can allow more individuals in a species to inherit that mutation. If the mutation is advantageous to the species, the mutation becomes part of the species, and develops into an adaptation (National Geographic 2017). This is an example of an evolutionary process known as natural selection, whereby individuals possessing traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and pass these traits on to the next generation (Cotton 2016, p.210).</p>
    <p><strong>Adaptations</strong> are structural, behavioural and physiological “features that enable organisms to survive and reproduce in different environments. They have a genetic basis and are passed from generation to generation” (Cotton 2016, p.210)</p>
    <p><strong>Structural adaptations</strong> are a physical feature of the organism that enhances its survival, for example having spines or thorns to deter predators and possessing large ears to assist with heat loss.</p>
    <p><strong>Behavioural adaptation</strong> is the way in which an organism acts to enhance its survival (National Geographic 2017), an example would be migration, exhibiting a behaviour that make the individual look bigger than it is to warn off predators, to fight for territory, tool use or “huddling to maintain body temperature” (Cotton 2016, p. 221).</p>
    <p><strong>Physiological adaptations</strong> are an internal body processes to regulate and maintain homeostasis for an organism to survive in the environment in which it exists, examples include temperature regulation, release of toxins or poisons, releasing antifreeze proteins to avoid freezing in cold environments and the release of nectar to attract prey.</p>

    <h3>Teaching sequence</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p><strong>Activity 1.1 - Introduction Adaptations:</strong> Introduction video on adaptations: Life-Venus Fly Traps Jaws of Death BBC One &amp; Blood Squirting Lizard Worlds Weirdest Nat Geo WILD and teacher instruction on adaptations.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity 1.2 - Hypothesising Adaptations Exploration:</strong> Students hypothesise what various adaptations are used for using the species cards.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity 1.3 - Matching Adaptations and Species:</strong> Students will match cards up of adaptation and organisms, students will see how many adaptations are shared between species. Students will brainstorm and discuss if these organisms live in similar environments.</p>
    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 1.1 - <strong>Introduction Adaptations</strong> (20 minutes)</p>
        <p>This activity will introduce students to some features of organisms and the advantages of possessing such features or behaviours. This activity will engage students in the topic, by showing unique adaptations of species, in addition to utilising species which students may not have known or learnt about before.</p>
