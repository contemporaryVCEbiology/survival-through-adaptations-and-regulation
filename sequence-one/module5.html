    <h1>Linking Adaptation Concepts</h1>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p class="intro">In this lesson, students will create a concept map about the ideas and understandings they have learnt on adaptations. They will use this activity as a revision tool to connect the ideas they have created and explored throughout the learning activities, including the species profile cards, secondary data investigation on the back rest behaviour and biomimicry solving human challenges.  Students will link these ideas on adaptations to previous knowledge in unit 1, and create connections between these ideas on the concept map.</p>

            <p>Survival through adaptations and regulation</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The structural, physiological and behavioural adaptations that enhance an organism’s survival and enable life to
exist in a wide range of environments</li>
                <li>Successful adaptations as models for biomimicry to solve human challenges</li>

            <h4>Student learning outcomes</h4>
            <p>At the completion of this lesson, students should be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the interconnectedness of adaptations and how they link to other areas of biology</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <p>This activity is designed to be used at the end of the lesson sequence on adaptation, however, can be used throughout the teaching and learning sequence. This concept map activity could be undertaken once the entire ‘Survival Through Adaptations and Regulation’ key knowledge is completed, then students can present more ideas, knowledge and interconnectedness on their concept map. This would mean the knowledge on homeostasis, regulation, stimulus-response model and diseases arising from homeostatic failures, could also be included on the concept map. This activity can be used for any biology concept and is a great tool to use at the conclusion of a biology outcome or unit.</p>
    <h4>Teacher Understanding</h4>
    <p>Concept maps allow students to visually see the relationships and connections between knowledge, which enhances student understandings through associations between key content and ideas. Concept maps are different to mind maps, as concept maps show and describe how different concepts link with each other. The creation of the concept maps will show a deep level of thinking and understanding, as students will not only be required to write their understanding of concepts, but also to describe how the concepts link together.</p>
    <h3>Teaching sequence</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p><strong>Activity 5.1 - Individual Concept Map:</strong> Students will individually create a concept map to link the ideas they’ve learnt about and explored throughout the adaptations sequence.</p>
    <p><strong>Activity 5.2 - Discussion and Class Concept Map:</strong> Students will discuss their ideas and they will be presented and linked on a whole class concept map.</p>
    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 5.1 - <strong>Individual Concept Map</strong> (40 minutes)</p>
        <h5>Teacher Explanation</h5>
        <p>This class we will be concluding the adaptations area of Unit 1 Biology. You will be required to individually create a concept map. Concept maps make it easier to visualise relationships between concepts and content knowledge. Concept maps are different to mind maps, in that concept maps have descriptions of the connections between the concepts, rather than just linking concepts together with lines and arrows. Your concept map can be used as a tool for revision for assessment. In your concept map, you should include as much information as possible about the content you have learnt on adaptations.</p>
        <p>Some of the things you should include are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Definition of adaptation</li>
            <li>Distinguish between behavioural, structural and physiological adaptations and provide examples of each</li>
            <li>Describe some adaptations that have been covered throughout this topic and link species which have similar adaptations to each other</li>
            <li>Your concept map should demonstrate your understanding of the adaptations shared between species living in similar environments</li>
            <li>The features and adaptations that are advantageous for different types of environments, and the shared adaptations between these environments</li>
            <li>The implications adaptations have on humans and their challenges</li>
            <li>You should also include information about your species for your species profile cards, and how that links to other components on your concept map</li>
            <li>Knowledge you have learned about the data investigation on the Sharp-tailed Sandpipers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The concept map can be created digitally, or on poster paper</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>Students will watch the below video on how to create a concept map https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZJj6DwCqSU</p>
        
        <p>Some useful concept map programs are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CmapTools</li>
            <li>Inspiration</li>
            <li>Powerpoint</li>
            <li>Word</li>
            <li>Lucidchart Concept Map Maker</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 5.2 - <strong>Discussion and Class Concept Map</strong> (20 minutes)</p>
        <p>Once students have completed their individual concept map, the amalgamation of ideas will be presented on a whole class concept map. All students will contribute to the class concept map. Students will have the opportunity to challenge other students’ ideas, links and explanations they have made. Links will also be made to other ideas in biology previously learnt. This activity will be completed on a projector, so all students can observe and participate. Each student will draw their own version of the class concept map into their notes books, or they will add it to their current concept map as a resource for assessment and exam preparation.</p>
